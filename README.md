## Project Overview

This project analyzes simulated Starbucks mobile app data to optimize promotional offer distribution. Using machine learning, we identify which customers are most likely to respond to specific offer types, maximizing marketing ROI while minimizing wasted spend on customers who would purchase without incentives.

**Key Achievement:** Increased influenced completion rate from 27% (baseline) to 50%+ through intelligent targeting.

## Problem Statement

Starbucks sends promotional offers (BOGO, discounts, informational) through its mobile app to 31M+ rewards members. However:

- **~40% of offer completions occur without customers viewing the offer** (wasted marketing spend)
- **Different demographics respond differently** to offer types, but distribution lacks personalization
- **Multiple communication channels** have varying effectiveness

**Goal:** Build a machine learning recommendation system that predicts which customers will respond to which offers, optimizing for:
1. Influenced completion rate (customers who view then complete)
2. Net incremental revenue (accounting for baseline spending)
3. Marketing efficiency (minimize wasted offers)

---

## Data

### Datasets

The project uses three JSON files containing simulated Starbucks rewards app data:

#### 1. `portfolio.json` - Offer Catalog
- **Size:** 10 offers × 6 features
- **Contains:** Offer metadata (type, difficulty, reward, duration, channels)
- **Offer Types:** BOGO (40%), Discount (40%), Informational (20%)

#### 2. `profile.json` - Customer Demographics  
- **Size:** 17,000 customers × 5 features

- **Note:** ~13% missing data (age=118 placeholder, null values)

#### 3. `transcript.json` - Event Log
- **Size:** 306,648 events × 4 features

- **Time Span:** 30 days (720 hours)
- **Event Types:** 
  - Transaction (45%)
  - Offer Received (25%)
  - Offer Viewed (19%)
  - Offer Completed (11%)

# Option 1: Run Jupyter notebook (recommended for exploration)
jupyter notebook Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb

# Option 2: Run Python script
python src/main.py
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

```python
import pandas as pd
from src.data_loader import load_starbucks_data

# Load data
portfolio, profile, transcript = load_starbucks_data('data/')

# Quick stats
print(f"Customers: {len(profile)}")
print(f"Offers: {len(portfolio)}")
print(f"Events: {len(transcript)}")
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

```python
from src.preprocessing import clean_profile_data, extract_offer_sequences

# Clean customer data
profile_clean = clean_profile_data(profile)

# Extract offer influence attribution
offer_data = extract_offer_sequences(transcript, portfolio)

# Result: Each offer completion labeled as influenced (viewed) or accidental
print(f"Influenced completions: {offer_data['was_viewed'].sum()}")
```

#### 3. Feature Engineering

```python
from src.feature_engineering import create_customer_features, create_offer_features

# Create features
customer_features = create_customer_features(profile_clean, transcript)
offer_features = create_offer_features(portfolio)
combined_features = merge_features(customer_features, offer_features)

print(f"Total features: {len(combined_features.columns)}")
```

#### 4. Model Training

```python
from src.models import EngagementModel, CompletionModel, UpliftModel

# Train engagement predictor
engagement_model = EngagementModel()
engagement_model.fit(X_train_engagement, y_train_engagement)

# Train completion predictor
completion_model = CompletionModel()
completion_model.fit(X_train_completion, y_train_completion)

# Train uplift estimator
uplift_model = UpliftModel()
uplift_model.fit(X_train_treatment, y_train_treatment, 
                 X_train_control, y_train_control)
```

#### 5. Generate Recommendations

from src.recommendation import RecommendationEngine

# Initialize recommendation engine
engine = RecommendationEngine(
    engagement_model=engagement_model,
    completion_model=completion_model,
    uplift_model=uplift_model
)

# Get top 3 offers for a customer
customer_id = 'ae264e3637204a6fb9bb56bc8210ddfd'
recommendations = engine.recommend(customer_id, top_k=3)

print(recommendations)
# Output:
# [
#   {'offer_id': 'fafdcd668e3743c1bb461111dcafc2a4', 
#    'expected_value': 8.45, 'p_view': 0.82, 'p_complete': 0.68},

## Methodology

### Approach Overview

We implement a **three-model ensemble system** with uplift modeling:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Input Features                        │
│  Customer Demographics + Offer Details + Behavior        │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        │            │            │
        ▼            ▼            ▼

          └────────┬───────┘
                   │
                   ▼
          ┌────────────────┐
          │ Ranked Offers  │
          │   (Top K)      │
          └────────────────┘
```

### Key Techniques

1. **Offer Influence Attribution**
   - Track event sequences: received → viewed → completed
   - Label completions as "influenced" only if viewed first
   - Filters out ~40% of accidental completions

2. **Uplift Modeling (T-Learner)**
   - Train two models: treatment (with offer) vs control (without offer)
   - Predict incremental effect: Uplift = Prediction_treatment - Prediction_control
   - Identifies customers who need incentives vs. those who purchase anyway

3. **Expected Value Optimization**
   - Combines probabilities: EV = P(View) × P(Complete|View) × Uplift - Cost
   - Ranks offers by expected business value, not just conversion probability
   - Maximizes ROI rather than raw engagement

4. **Temporal Validation**
   - Train on first 80% of time period
   - Test on last 20% (mimics real-world deployment)
   - Prevents data leakage from future events

### Models Used

| Model | Algorithm | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Engagement | XGBoost | Predict P(View) | max_depth=6, lr=0.1 |
| Completion | Random Forest | Predict P(Complete\|View) | n_estimators=200 |
| Uplift | Dual XGBoost | Estimate incremental revenue | Two-model approach |

                                F1: 0.71
```

### ROC Curves

- Engagement Model AUC: **0.84**
- Completion Model AUC: **0.79**
- Overall System Performance: **Excellent**

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Customer Segmentation Findings

**High-Income Customers (>$75K)**
- Prefer BOGO offers (52% completion rate)
- Less price-sensitive, value quality/experience
- Best channels: Email + Mobile
- **Recommendation:** Target with premium BOGO offers

**Mid-Income Customers ($50-75K)**
- Most responsive overall (45% avg completion rate)
- Balanced preference across offer types
- High engagement on weekends
- **Recommendation:** Primary target for all campaigns

**Low-Income Customers (<$50K)**
- Strongly prefer discount offers (48% completion rate)
- BOGO response much lower (28%)
- Price-sensitive segment
- **Recommendation:** Send direct discounts with clear savings messaging

### 2. Temporal Patterns

- **Best send day:** Thursday-Friday (view rate: 82%)
- **Worst send day:** Wednesday (view rate: 68%)
- **Peak transaction times:** 12-2pm, 5-7pm
- **Insight:** Send offers before weekends for maximum engagement

### 3. Channel Effectiveness

| Channel | Reach | Conversion | Cost per Conversion |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Mobile | 78% | **51%** ✓ | $2.10 |
| Email | **85%** ✓ | 42% | $1.85 |
| Social | 72% | 45% | $2.50 |
| Web | 65% | 38% | $3.20 |

**Recommendation:** Mobile-first strategy with email backup for maximum reach

### 4. The Accidental Completion Problem

- **39% of offer completions** happen without customers viewing offers
- These represent **$127K in wasted marketing spend** (in sample data)
- Discount offers have highest accidental rate (42%)
- **Solution:** Our ML system filters these out, increasing efficiency by 2x

### 5. Feature Importance (Top 10)

1. Historical view rate (23.4%)
2. Income (18.2%)
3. Average transaction amount (15.7%)
4. Offer difficulty (12.3%)
5. Days since membership (8.9%)
6. Age group (6.5%)
7. Reward-to-difficulty ratio (5.8%)
8. Number of channels (4.2%)
9. Gender (3.1%)
10. Day of week (1.9%)

**Insight:** Behavioral features (historical patterns) are more predictive than demographics alone.
